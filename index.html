                    <p>
                        When I started my programming studies, I wasn't sure which way to go. Thanks to the guidance of several people, mainly my brother, I began this wonderful world of programming and databases. I remember that we started with relational databases, there I
                        took my first steps with Oracle and PL / SQL, which opened my mind to a world of possibilities. I was always curious to learn new things and because of this during the first terms of my training I was chosen to participate in the
                        Python bootcamp carried out by a well-known virtual educational entity. There, I learned about algorithms, OOP, and it was then when I met and began to love Python, it was like love at first sight. In this bootcamp, I developed,
                        coperatively, several projects in CLI and others using Html. When I finished this amazing experience I was certified as a Phyton and Django back-end developer, getting a special aknowledgement for my good attitude, performance
                        and hard work.
